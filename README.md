# 🌐Cybersecurity Resources 🔒

There's a ton of resources out there for the cybersecurity industry. Here is my own curated list of different resources across a number of different platforms:

## <a href="discord.md"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6257adef93867e50d84d30e2/636e0b5061df29d55a92d945_full_logo_blurple_RGB.svg" alt="Discord" width="150"/></a>

Networking is a cornerstone of the cybersecurity industry. By sharing knowledge and learning from others, you actively participate in the community and drive innovation forward. Imagine if Google had been just an idea in a hidden notebook rather than a shared vision. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to grow and connect—join any of these communities and engage with like-minded individuals who share your passion for cybersecurity.
